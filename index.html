                <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                <p>Given more time I think I would have just added in some simple things that most engines have, stuff like an OnStart or OnAwake thats basically and object's constructor. 
                    I have been trying to recreate stuff that you might see in an engine like Unity. So things like onCollisionEnter, onCollisionStay, onCollisionLeave (and ones for triggers) are some of the things I think my engine should have.
                    Some of these things are simple and wouldn't take too much time to implement so I might've been able to get it done but with more time I could add even more of these features so my engine feels a lot more user friendly and open to more types of games.
                    I also would've liked to clean up my load scene, or anything relating to how I save and load my data from a file. I don't really know how to do it without expecting certain components and kind of hard coding things but I would've liked to have come up with a better system that is a little more flexible and less specific.
                    Additionally, I had child objects and a parent object field in my gameobjects but it doesn't do anything so in the future I would've wanted to do something with that.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>I also think my scene editor could definitely use some work. Same as this website, I don't really like the UI and how it looks. I'm not good with making good looking UI so with extra time I would like to have designed the tool to look a little nicer. Also more utility to it, I really didn't know what to add to it because as I said I was modeling off of other engines like Unity, but I can't make my scene editor look as nice as theirs.
                    I didn't really know what to add besides adding and removing. I could've added a duplicate button which would've been easy but as I said I don't like how the UI looks, the way i just have like 2 buttons on top of almost all the columns would've been even uglier if I added a third button. But that duplicate button would have been useful cause sometimes it was easier to duplicate an object in the json itself. I guess that makes me think that another good functionality to add is editing the string rather than just having to update it.
                    Also going back to how i said previously I didn't like how I saved and loaded scenes, so I would also have to edit that here if I figured out a new way. Something else related to the tool is that I'd like to not force people to install wxPython on their own. I tried tomake it auto install through building macbuild but it didn't work and I didn't like the other ways to do it that I saw.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>SDL3 has not the best online resources and documentation outside their wiki so it was a struggle figuring some things out (especially audio). I mainly say this because I wish I was able to get text to print to the screen. I know SDL2 has SDL_TTF but I couldn't get the SDL3 version working.
                   So I had to resort to using images of words to print to the screen.
